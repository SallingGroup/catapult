A Catapult transition is a way of defining how the current state changes to another one. The transitions implement a _next_
method that will return the next state based on the current CatapultContext. The actual tasks for looking up OpenShift
projects are located in the adapter that belongs to the current state. The transition only looks in the CatapultContext
for things that are needed for entering the next state.
The start state for all transitions is always INITIAL and the end state is always DONE.

=== PushTransition
* INITIAL +
The pushTransition will look for a catapult template in the current CatapultContext.
** CATAPULT TEMPLATE NOT FOUND +
If it is not found, the current request is not for the Catapult and the CATAPULT TEMPLATE NOT FOUND state is entered.
*** DONE +
Nothing further will happen for this request.
** CATAPULT TEMPLATE FOUND +
If the template is found, the CATAPULT TEMPLATE FOUND state is entered. The next state is determined by looking at the OpenShift
project.
*** OPENSHIFT PROJECT FOUND +
If it is found, the OPENSHIFT PROJECT FOUND state is entered. From here then next state is determined by looking at the
template.
**** CATAPULT TEMPLATE CHANGED +
If the template has changed then CATAPULT TEMPLATE CHANGED state is entered, the template modifications will be processed
and the respective build triggers will be activated.
***** DONE
**** CATAPULT TEMPLATE NOT CHANGED +
If the template has not changed, then the CATAPULT TEMPLATE NOT CHANGED state is entered, and any respective build triggers are triggered.
***** DONE
*** OPENSHIFT PROJECT NOT FOUND +
If no OpenShift project was found then OPENSHIFT PROJECT NOT FOUND state is entered. The next state is determined by looking
at the OpenShift project and waiting for it to be created so the OPENSHIFT PROJECT CREATED state can be entered.
**** OPENSHIFT PROJECT CREATED

==== CatapultOpenShiftPolicyBindingsTransition
Now the transition will look at policybindings and enter the POLICY BINDINGS UPDATED state when they are updated.
This is implemented in a separate transition so it can be reused and so the corresponding adapter implementation can be customized.

==== CatapultOpenShiftSecretsTransition
The next transiton is for secrets. If there are no secrets to manage for this request, the NO SECRETS FOUND state is entered, otherwise the SECRETS UPDATES
state is entered.

==== CatapultOpenShiftConfigMapsTransition
The next transition is for configmaps, if there are no configmaps found, then the NO CONFIGMAPS FOUND state is entered,
otherwise the CONFIGMAPS UPDATED state is entered.

It is now time for the transition to determine if OpenShift could process
the catapult template. If there are errors, then the CATAPULT TEMPLATE PROCESS ERROR state is entered, otherwise the CATAPULT TEMPLATE PROCESSED state is entered.
The transition is now finished and ends with the state DONE.
This transition is also illustrated on figure 1 below.

=== PullRequestTransition
* INITIAL +
The PullTransition will first determine if the request repository has a catapult template.
** CATAPULT TEMPLATE NOT FOUND +
If a template is not found, then nothing is done for this request.
*** DONE
** CATAPULT TEMPLATE FOUND +
If a template is found, then the project is looked up in OpenShift.
*** OPENSHIFT PROJECT NOT FOUND +
If no project is found in OpenShift, then the state is changed to OPENSHIFT PROJECT NOT FOUND and nothing will happen for this request.
**** DONE
*** OPENSHIFT PROJECT FOUND +
If an OpenShift project is found, it will be deleted
**** OPENSHIFT PROJECT DELETED +
Once the project is deleted, the catapult will enter the OPENSHIFT PROJECT DELETED state and nothing more will happen for this request.
***** DONE

This transition is also illustrated on figure 2 below.

=== ReleaseTransition
* INITIAL +
The ReleaseTransition will look for an OpenShift project in the current context.
** RELEASE PROJECT FOUND +
If an OpenShift release project is found then the next state is RELEASE PROJECT FOUND. The found project will be removed and a new lookup will be performed.
The state will remain RELEASE PROJECT FOUND while any viable release projects are found.
** RELEASE PROJECT NOT FOUND +
If no release project is found (either by no release project existing or all having been removed), the transition will enter RELEASE PROJECT NOT FOUND. +
After entering RELEASE PROJECT NOT FOUND the state transition will continue as a PushTransition.
