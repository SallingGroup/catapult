A Catapult strategy is a group of states and tasks that, when executed, will produce an end result like a new OpenShift
project without having to do any manual tasks.

== Strategies

The Catapult has three different strategies. These are Push-, Pull- and ReleaseStrategy. These strategies have a set of
states where a set of tasks is executed.
The transition between these different states is handled by the Push-, Pull- and ReleaseTransition classes.

=== Pushrequest strategy
The goal of the push request strategy is to ensure that if the source repository has a catapult template, an OpenShift
project will be created with all the default permissions, secrets etc. without any manual tasks from the developer/user.
This strategy is activated when the webhook trigger is a push request. This strategy will ensure that an OpenShift
project exists and that annotated builds are executed. If the OpenShift project already exists, then only the build(s) are triggered.

=== Pullrequest strategy
The goal of the pull request strategy is to provide some simple cleanup in OpenShift so projects that are no longer needed
are removed.
This strategy is activated when the webhook that was triggered is a pull request. This strategy will cleanup (Remove) the
OpenShift project and the following push request will trigger the push request strategy and ensure that the annotated
builds of that project will be executed.

=== Releaserequest strategy
The goal of a release strategy is to build one or more images to an external repository so that theses images can be
deployed/released to production environment(s). It is the goal for the release strategy to automate as much as possible
regarding the release of new features on OpenShift projects.
This strategy is activated when the webhook is a tag request. The release project will have the same name as the tag that
was created and the annotated build(s) will be triggered to produce a release.
This strategy will replace annotated imagestreams with a specified release repository where images will be pushed to during build.
