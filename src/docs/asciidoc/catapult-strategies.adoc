A Catapult strategy is a group of states and tasks that, when executed, will produce an end result like a new OpenShift
project without having to do any manual tasks.

== Strategies
The Catapult has a strategy concept that groups the states and tasks that have to be executed. The CatapultStrategy
implements the plumbing for starting the state machine and making it run through to the done state.
